# 👋 Hi, I’m Maitri Gada

I’m a software engineer and AI enthusiast currently pursuing my MS in Artificial Intelligence & Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University. I like my models **fast**, my infrastructure **clean**, and my systems **production-ready**.

### 👩‍💻 What I’ve Been Building
- 🐶 **Vet Copilot @ Chewy** — A real-time AI assistant for veterinary Q&A and product recommendations (FastAPI, LangChain, Amazon Neptune).
- 🧠 **ForgeBench** — Capstone with Bank of New York Mellon: enterprise-grade LLM evaluation infra with MLflow, DVC, and compliance constraints.
- 🎬 **Movie Recommender** — Real-time, production-grade system with Kafka, PostgreSQL, and CI/CD.
- 🎨 **Diffusion for Animation** — Timestep-conditioned image generation comparing 5 models across 16K cartoon frames.

### 🧠 I’m Currently Learning
- How to act (*literally* — taking an acting course this semester!)
- Prompt engineering for structured outputs and realistic simulations
- How to build robust, low-latency, scalable AI systems under resource constraints

### 🌱 Outside of Work
I’m usually:
- Practicing yoga 🧘🏽‍♀️
- Strumming my ukulele 🎶
- Swimming laps 🏊🏽‍♀️
- Obsessing over dogs (all sizes welcome 🐕)
