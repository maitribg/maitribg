# 👋 Hi, I’m Maitri Gada

I’m a software engineer and AI enthusiast currently pursuing my MS in Artificial Intelligence & Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University. I like my models fast, my infrastructure clean, and my systems production-ready.

### 👩‍💻 What I’ve Been Building
- 🐶 **Vet Copilot @ Chewy**: A real-time AI assistant for veterinary Q&A and product recommendations (FastAPI, LangChain, Amazon Neptune)
- 🧠 **ForgeBench with Bank of New York Mellon**: Enterprise-grade LLM evaluation infrastructure using MLflow, DVC, and compliance constraints
- 🎬 **Movie Recommender**: Real-time production system using Kafka, PostgreSQL, CI/CD, and cloud monitoring
- 🎨 **Diffusion for Animation**: Timestep-conditioned image generation comparing 5 models across 16K cartoon frames

### 🧠 I’m Currently Learning
- How to act (literally, I’m taking an acting course this semester)
- Prompt engineering for structured outputs and realistic simulations
- How to build robust, low-latency, scalable AI systems under resource constraints

### 🌱 Outside of Work
I’m usually:
- Practicing yoga 🧘🏽‍♀️
- Playing my ukulele 🎶
- Swimming laps 🏊🏽‍♀️
- Obsessing over dogs (all sizes welcome 🐕)
